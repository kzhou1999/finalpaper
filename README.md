# The Puzzle of the Distinct Solitude Experiences in Our Daily Life

This repo explores the factors that may correlate to the positive solitude experience and the negative solitude experience, and the positive solitude experience. I use the data collected through an experiment at the University of British Columbia: One hundred community-dwelling adults and 50 students completed approximately 30 daily life assessments on their current and desired social situation, thoughts, and affect over ten days for this experiment. I cleaned the raw dataset and visualized it for my paper. I also fitted two linear models according to the vif values and the BIC backward selection. The analysis and report are created in a fully reproducible way.

**Key findings**

Greater social quality, higher self-efficacy, and less anxiety are the keys to a better solitude experience. Greater age help improve the solitude experience, but the impact is tiny.
